     </b>
</h2>

Hello! 👋

My name is Itish Srivastava and this is my first small project, a rather simple music player made using ```Frontend-Development-Technologies```. 

I have provided the code for my project, and have also listed the ```Tech Stack``` involved in my project.

My GitHub profile: <a href="https://github.com/Legendary-Person/Legendary-Person">```https://github.com/Legendary-Person/Legendary-Person```</a>

```Click on the``` ```{```<a href="https://github.com/Legendary-Person/Music-Player">```🔰```</a>```}``` ```in order to get redirected towards the main repository where I have posted all the files, you can also read this``` ```README.md``` ```for an idea of the project.```

            📣 Note
    </b> 
</h2>

- The Music Player isn't API based, therefore you will need to either manually add the songs (a folder) in your project directory or use .mp3 links.
- You will need to host your project on a server, like Wamp Server because, for security reasons, your browser wouldn't access your local files.
- The webpage isn't responsive, meaning that it will not automatically resize itself according to the device you are using, in conclusion, looking at the final product on laptop/desktop will be different from looking at in on mobile phone.
